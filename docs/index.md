# delayer-aws documentation

Simplistic cloud-native distributed scheduler, serverlessly built on top of AWS services

The delayer-aws' core values are:

*   simplistic: set a point in time in the future and let delayer call an HTTP request or put message in a SQS queue in a reliable way for you
*   serverless: as a consequence of simplicity, there's no need to take care about servers
